        For over 9 years, I was an Army medic, stationed only in Kentucky and Washington. At the age for 18, I went to
        college for a pre-med degree, but in order to be looked at for medical school I had to stand out. The way I
        wanted to stand out was to volunteer as a medic. During my first contract I was really motivated about what I
        was doing and signed another contract for 6 more years. I ended up in Washington state and found myself wanting
        a bigger challenge. I linked up with Operation Code where I have been a part of for 2 years working on APIs,
        back-end, and other issues that may arise. I liked it so much that I started college from scratch in computer
        science. My goal is to learn Machine Learning which I am very interested in and use that knowledge to create
        something that will better the world!
